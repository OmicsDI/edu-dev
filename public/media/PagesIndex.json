The user` can search in the  textfield\nfor a certain category and the system will filter the categories by the keywords the user specifies. For example (Figure 2), if the user is interested\nin `brain tissue, then s/he can see all the tissues containing the keyword brain`.\n\n{{ highlight bash}}\nNotice that most of the filters are free text based meaning that their values rely on the\nannotations provided by the specific databases.\n\nOmicsDI Team is always improving the automatic annotation system to move more attributes/properties of the dataset\nfrom Free-Text to ontology-based values.\n{{ / highlight }}\n\n/br/br\n\n Ranking Results\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/ranking.png\" title=\"Figure 3: Ranking the Search Results\"}}\n\nThe final results of the search can be sorted by three different categories: `Accession, Relevance, Publication Date`. The\n`Accession is the accession of the datasets in the system; the Relevance` is how close is the dataset to specific query; the\n`Publication Date` sort the datasets by publication date.\n\nRelevance\n\n{{ highlight html}}\n\nThe actual search is done via a call to Apache Lucene, which takes two arguments: the query and an upper bound on the number of hits (datasets) to return.\nLucene scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given Document is to a User's query. In general, the idea behind the VSM is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. It uses the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of boolean logic in the Query specification. Lucene also adds some capabilities and refinements onto this model to support boolean and fuzzy searching, but it essentially remains a VSM based system at the heart.\n\n{{ / highlight }}",

        "content": "\nThe main goal of the Omics Discovery Index is to provide a platform for `searching and linking` omics public data.\nOmicsDI has implemented a unique and novel `Search Engine` for omics datasets including public and protected data.\n\nThe OmicsDI Search Box\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/search-box.png\" title=\"Figure 1: OmicsDI Search Box\" }}\n\nThe `OmicsDI Search Box is the main component to searching in OmicsDI. The user` can type a set of keywords that will enable the system\nto find the datasets containing those keywords.\n\n{{ highlight bash}}\nIf the user uses double quote \"breast cancer\" in their search the system will try to find the exact sentence in the datasets.\n{{ / highlight }}\n\nThe `OmicsDI Search Box provides a unique auto-complete feature that enables user` to select sentence after typing a subset of keywords. For example,\nFigure 2 shows all sentences/phrases in OmicsDI containing the words breast cancer.\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/search-box-autocomplete.png\" title=\"Figure 2: OmicsDI Search Box with Auto-complete\" }}\n\n Query Syntax\n\nWhen the user types any text in `OmicsDI Search Box`, the input is translated into an Apache Lucene query that is then executed\nto get the search results. The actual query executed is generated following the typical Apache Lucene query syntax in order to\nprovide a generic approach avoiding complex query rearrangements.\n\nMultiple search terms separated by white spaces are combined by default in `AND` logic. Therefore an input text containing for example\n`glutathione transferase is treated as glutathione AND transferase` and only entries having both terms will be found. The default order\nof results is based on their relevance, i.e. the proximity of the terms in the entries.\n\nTable 1: Overview of some useful query syntax elements is presented.\n\n|    Element    |      Meaning      |      Usage        |                 Example                |                             Notes                          |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `AND`           | In addition to        | term1 AND term2       | glutathione AND transferase                | Matches entries where both glutathione and transferase occur.  |\n| `OR`            | Equivalence           | term1 OR term2        | glutathione OR transferase                 | Matches entries where either glutathione or transferase occur. |\n| `NOT`           | Exclusion             | term1 NOT term2       | coding NOT fragment                        | Matches entries containing  coding  but not fragment.          |\n| ``             | Wildcard              | partialTerm          | gluta*                                     | Matches for instance glutathione, glutamate, glutamic.         |\n| \" \"               | Exact match           | \"quoted text\"         | \"x-ray diffraction\"                        | Exact matching for entries containing x-ray diffraction.       |\n| `( )`           | Grouping              | (text)                | (reductase OR transferase) AND glutathione |                                                                |\n| `Field:`        | Field-specific search | fieldId:term          | description:dopamine                       | Matches for a field description containing dopamine.           |\n\nEscaping special characters\n\nThe following characters within queries require to be escaped (using a ' \\ ' before the character to escape) in order to be correctly interpreted:\n\n{{ highlight bash}}\n- & | ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ \" ~ * ? : \\ /\n{{ / highlight }}\n\nSince Apache Lucene supports regular expression searches (matching a pattern between forwarding slashes) the forward slash ' / ' has become a special character to be escaped. For example to search for\n`cancer/testis use the query cancer\\/testis`. If special characters are not escaped the actual query performed may be different from what expected.\n\n Query examples\n\nFollowing the aforementioned query syntax, users can easily search and filter results according to data content and characteristics.\nA few examples of queries that can be performed using EBI Search are listed below.\n\nSearch for insulin receptor.\nSearch Datasets that identified a href=\"http://www.omicsdi.org/search?q=(UNIPROT:%20(%22P07900%22))\"P07900/a\n\nSearching using Biological Evidence\n\nThe `OmicsDI Search Box` allows the end-users to search data using biological evidence such as the list of the proteins identified in the proteomics experiment or the metabolites\nreported in the Metabolomics experiment. For example (Figure 3), if the user searches for `3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic` in the resource it will find one dataset in Metaboligths and five in Metabolome workbench\nthat identified the current molecule.\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/search-biological-evidences.png\" title=\"Figure 3: Search for Biological evidences  3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic\" }}\n\nThe final search results are shown in the browser page including `Refine Filters`. a href='{{< relref \"filter-results.md\" }}'Read More Here/a.",

        "content": "\nOmics Discovery Index is an integrated and open source platform\nfacilitating the access and dissemination of omics datasets. It provides a unique infrastructure to integrate\ndatasets coming from multiple omics studies, including at present proteomics, genomics, transcriptomics and\nmetabolomics.\n\nOmicsDI stores metadata coming from the public datasets from every resource using an efficient\nindexing system, which is able to integrate different biological entities including\ngenes, proteins and metabolites with the relevant life science literature. OmicsDI is updated daily, as new datasets get\npublicly available in the contributing repositories.\n\nOmics Data Submission\n\nThe increasing role of huge datasets in scientific research has important implications for the way the research\nis conducted, for the way it should be organized and funded, and for the training of new researchers.\nHowever, the advances in biomedical research depend on scientists’ ability to consult and use all available data,\nindependently from where they were originally produced: data sharing on a global scale is the best way to\n‘advance science for the public good’.\n\nThe assumption underlying this policy is that the more scientists are allowed to access the same sets of data,\nthe more those data will be used to produce new knowledge about biological phenomena.\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/databases-workflow.png\" title=\"Figure 1: Current Schema of BioMedical Data Distribution/Dissemination \" }}\n\nFigure 1 shows how data is produced/stored and distributed in biomedical research. The result of an omics experiment (e.g Proteomics or Metabolomics)\nis submitted to a public Archive (e.g PRIDE or Metaboligths). These Data Archives provide a common interface for submission,\nvalidation and downloading of the original results/data. Importantly, each individual repository/archive define three major\ncomponents to guide the submission process:\n\nThe metadata guidelines including Standards and Ontologies to define/describe a dataset and corresponding components (e.g. samples, instruments).\nFile formats to store and handle the underlying data in the Dataset.\nThe submission guidelines define how to submit and retrieve the data from the repository.\n\nIn recent years the number of databases and archives has growth in all omics fields [1]. For example,\nin Proteomics the results of a Mass spectrometry experiment can be submitted to four different databases members of\nProteomeXchange: PeptideAtlas/PASSEL, PRIDE, MassIVE, jPOST. In addition, each omics field\nhas developed and grown independently of the other fields including their metadata specifications, file formats, and submission\nguidelines. For this reason, most of the Data Archives are field specific (e.g. Metabolomics - Metaboligths, Metabolomics Workbench).\n\n Omics Data Dissemination\n\nAfter the data is submitted to a formal a href='{{< ref \"#omics-data-submission\" }}'Archive/a, Knowledge Base Databases\n(BDs) reuse part of the public data to respond to specific questions (e.g. Gene Expression Profiles - ExpressionAtlas). The\nnumber of these DBs has growth in recent years. For example, Table 1 shows the list of Protein Expression Databases [1] that include\npeptide sequences, post-translational modifications, expression profiles.\n\nTable 1: Proteomics Knowledge Base Databases (BDs) including information about Protein Expression informations (e.g\nPeptides Sequences, Post-Translational Modifications).\n\n| ﻿Resource                   | URL                                        | Publication                   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Cancer Mutant Proteome Database | http://cgbc.cgu.edu.tw/cmpd/                   | Nucleic Acids Res. 2015.          |\n| MOPED                           | https://www.proteinspire.org/MOPED/            | Nucleic Acids Res. 2015.          |\n| ProteomicsDB                    | https://www.proteomicsdb.org/                  | Nature. 2014                      |\n| MaxQB                           | http://maxqb.biochem.mpg.de/mxdb/              | Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012         |\n| GPMDB                           | http://gpmdb.thegpm.org/                       |                                   |\n| COPaKB                          | http://www.heartproteome.org/copa/Default.aspx | Circ Res. 2013                    |\n| paxDB                           | http://pax-db.org/#!home                       | Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012         |\n| Human Proteinpedia              | http://www.humanproteinpedia.org/              | Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2013  |\n| Human Proteome Map              | http://www.humanproteomemap.org/               | Nature. 2014                      |\n\nOmicsDI Vision\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/vision.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"left\"}}\n\nAll these databases/repositories have created a complex and distributed scenario where the data can\nbe submitted into different Archives and reused in multiple and different DBs.
