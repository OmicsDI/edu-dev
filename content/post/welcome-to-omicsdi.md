[Omics Discovery Index](http://www.omicsdi.org) is an integrated and open source platform
facilitating the access and dissemination of omics datasets. It provides a unique infrastructure to integrate
datasets coming from multiple omics studies, including at present **proteomics**, **genomics**, **transcriptomics** and
**metabolomics**.


OmicsDI stores metadata coming from the public datasets from every resource using an efficient
indexing system, which is able to integrate different biological entities including
genes, proteins and metabolites with the relevant life science literature. OmicsDI is updated daily, as new datasets get
publicly available in the contributing repositories.
