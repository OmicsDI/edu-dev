The user` can search in the  textfield\nfor a certain category and the system will filter the categories by the keywords the user specifies. For example (Figure 2), if the user is interested\nin `brain tissue, then s/he can see all the tissues containing the keyword brain`.\n\n{{ highlight bash}}\nNotice that most of the filters are free text based meaning that their values rely on the\nannotations provided by the specific databases.\n\nOmicsDI Team is always improving the automatic annotation system to move more attributes/properties of the dataset\nfrom Free-Text to ontology-based values.\n{{ / highlight }}\n\n/br/br\n\n Ranking Results\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/ranking.png\" title=\"Figure 3: Ranking the Search Results\"}}\n\nThe final results of the search can be sorted by three different categories: `Accession, Relevance, Publication Date`. The\n`Accession is the accession of the datasets in the system; the Relevance` is how close is the dataset to specific query; the\n`Publication Date` sort the datasets by publication date.\n\nRelevance\n\n{{ highlight html}}\n\nThe actual search is done via a call to Apache Lucene, which takes two arguments: the query and an upper bound on the number of hits (datasets) to return.\nLucene scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given Document is to a User's query. In general, the idea behind the VSM is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. It uses the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of boolean logic in the Query specification. Lucene also adds some capabilities and refinements onto this model to support boolean and fuzzy searching, but it essentially remains a VSM based system at the heart.\n\n{{ / highlight }}",

The enzyme was set as Trypsin, and up to 2 missed cleavages were permitted. The false discovery rate for peptide and protein identifications was set to1%, and rest of the parameters were set at the default settings. As part of the default settings, the mass tolerance for precursor ions was set to 20 ppm for the first search where initial mass recalibration was completed and a 6 ppm precursor mass tolerance was used for the main search. The mass tolerance for fragment ions was 0.5 Da. We also included match between runs and re-quantification of the searched peptides. The search results were exported toExcel for further data analysis as described below. Only the protein and peptide identifications with no-zeropositive ratios (H/L 0) were used in subsequent data analysis steps. The methionine-containing peptides wereselected, and those methionine-containing peptides consistently identified in the protein samples derived from sixor more denaturant-containing buffers were assayed. For the methionine-containing peptides, a single averaged H/Lratio was calculated for each peptide sequence and each charge state at each denaturant concentration. Similarly, for each analysis, a median H/L ratio was determined for each protein using the H/L ratios measured for all thenon-methionine-containing peptides identified in all the denaturant concentrations for a given protein. These medianH/L ratios were used to select hits with H/L2 fold in the protein expression level analyses. For hit peptide andprotein selection in the thermodynamic analyses, all the H/L ratios generated for the non-methionine containingpeptides from a given protein were divided by the median H/L ratio for that protein in order to generate normalizedH/L ratios for each non-methionine containing peptide. These normalized H/L ratios were log2 transformed. Thenormalized and log2 transformed H/L ratios generated for the non-methionine-containing peptides in a given analysiswere used to determine the 5th and 95th percentiles values used in subsequent analysis of methionine-containingpeptides. The averaged H/L ratios calculated for each methionine-containing peptides were also normalized and log2transformed. The methionine-containing peptides and proteins with log2 transformed H/L ratios less than the 5thpercentile or greater than the 95th percentile values determined above were selected and then visually inspected todetermine which peptides had altered H/L ratios at 2 or more consecutive denaturant concentrations to generate aninitial list of protein hits.\",\n    \"sample_protocol\": \"SILAC labeled MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lysates were prepared according to established SILAC protocols.

The light and heavy samples generated at matching denaturant concentration were combined. Each combined protein sample was submitted to a bottom-up, solution-phase, shotgun proteomics analysis using LC-MS/MS. Ultimately, L/H ratios were obtained for the peptides detected at each denaturant concentration, and the denaturant dependence of the L/H ratioâ€™s was examined.\"\n    }\n{{ / highlight }}\n\nPagination\n\nResponses containing multiple datasets are paginated to prevent accidental downloads\nof large amounts of data and to speed up the `API.

The actual query executed is generated following the typical Apache Lucene query syntax in order to\nprovide a generic approach avoiding complex query rearrangements.\n\nMultiple search terms separated by white spaces are combined by default in `AND` logic. Therefore an input text containing for example\n`glutathione transferase is treated as glutathione AND transferase` and only entries having both terms will be found. The default order\nof results is based on their relevance, i.e. the proximity of the terms in the entries.\n\nTable 1: Overview of some useful query syntax elements is presented.\n\n|    Element    |      Meaning      |      Usage        |                 Example                |                             Notes                          |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `AND`           | In addition to        | term1 AND term2       | glutathione AND transferase                | Matches entries where both glutathione and transferase occur.  |\n| `OR`            | Equivalence           | term1 OR term2        | glutathione OR transferase                 | Matches entries where either glutathione or transferase occur. |\n| `NOT`           | Exclusion             | term1 NOT term2       | coding NOT fragment                        | Matches entries containing  coding  but not fragment.          |\n| ``             | Wildcard              | partialTerm          | gluta*                                     | Matches for instance glutathione, glutamate, glutamic.         |\n| \" \"               | Exact match           | \"quoted text\"         | \"x-ray diffraction\"                        | Exact matching for entries containing x-ray diffraction.       |\n| `( )`           | Grouping              | (text)                | (reductase OR transferase) AND glutathione |                                                                |\n| `Field:`        | Field-specific search | fieldId:term          | description:dopamine                       | Matches for a field description containing dopamine.           |\n\nEscaping special characters\n\nThe following characters within queries require to be escaped (using a ' \\ ' before the character to escape) in order to be correctly interpreted:\n\n{{ highlight bash}}\n- & | ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ \" ~ * ? : \\ /\n{{ / highlight }}\n\nSince Apache Lucene supports regular expression searches (matching a pattern between forwarding slashes) the forward slash ' / ' has become a special character to be escaped. For example to search for\n`cancer/testis use the query cancer\\/testis`. If special characters are not escaped the actual query performed may be different from what expected.\n\n Query examples\n\nFollowing the aforementioned query syntax, users can easily search and filter results according to data content and characteristics.\nA few examples of queries that can be performed using EBI Search are listed below.\n\nSearch for insulin receptor.\nSearch Datasets that identified a href=\"http://www.omicsdi.org/search?q=(UNIPROT:%20(%22P07900%22))\"P07900/a\n\nSearching using Biological Evidence\n\nThe `OmicsDI Search Box` allows the end-users to search data using biological evidence such as the list of the proteins identified in the proteomics experiment or the metabolites\nreported in the Metabolomics experiment. For example (Figure 3), if the user searches for `3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic` in the resource it will find one dataset in Metaboligths and five in Metabolome workbench\nthat identified the current molecule.\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/search-biological-evidences.png\" title=\"Figure 3: Search for Biological evidences  3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic\" }}\n\nThe final search results are shown in the browser page including `Refine Filters`. a href='{{< relref \"filter-results.md\" }}'Read More Here/a.",

Importantly, each individual repository/archive define three major\ncomponents to guide the submission process:\n\nThe metadata guidelines including Standards and Ontologies to define/describe a dataset and corresponding components (e.g. samples, instruments).\nFile formats to store and handle the underlying data in the Dataset.\nThe submission guidelines define how to submit and retrieve the data from the repository.\n\nIn recent years the number of databases and archives has growth in all omics fields [1]. For example,\nin Proteomics the results of a Mass spectrometry experiment can be submitted to four different databases members of\nProteomeXchange: PeptideAtlas/PASSEL, PRIDE, MassIVE, jPOST. In addition, each omics field\nhas developed and grown independently of the other fields including their metadata specifications, file formats, and submission\nguidelines. For this reason, most of the Data Archives are field specific (e.g. Metabolomics - Metaboligths, Metabolomics Workbench).\n\n Omics Data Dissemination\n\nAfter the data is submitted to a formal a href='{{< ref \"#omics-data-submission\" }}'Archive/a, Knowledge Base Databases\n(BDs) reuse part of the public data to respond to specific questions (e.g. Gene Expression Profiles - ExpressionAtlas). The\nnumber of these DBs has growth in recent years. For example, Table 1 shows the list of Protein Expression Databases [1] that include\npeptide sequences, post-translational modifications, expression profiles.\n\nTable 1: Proteomics Knowledge Base Databases (BDs) including information about Protein Expression informations (e.g\nPeptides Sequences, Post-Translational Modifications).\n\n| ﻿Resource                   | URL                                        | Publication                   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Cancer Mutant Proteome Database | http://cgbc.cgu.edu.tw/cmpd/                   | Nucleic Acids Res. 2015.          |\n| MOPED                           | https://www.proteinspire.org/MOPED/            | Nucleic Acids Res. 2015.          |\n| ProteomicsDB                    | https://www.proteomicsdb.org/                  | Nature. 2014                      |\n| MaxQB                           | http://maxqb.biochem.mpg.de/mxdb/              | Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012         |\n| GPMDB                           | http://gpmdb.thegpm.org/                       |                                   |\n| COPaKB                          | http://www.heartproteome.org/copa/Default.aspx | Circ Res. 2013                    |\n| paxDB                           | http://pax-db.org/#!home                       | Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012         |\n| Human Proteinpedia              | http://www.humanproteinpedia.org/              | Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2013  |\n| Human Proteome Map              | http://www.humanproteomemap.org/               | Nature. 2014                      |\n\nOmicsDI Vision\n\n{{ figure src=\"/media/vision.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"left\"}}\n\nAll these databases/repositories have created a complex and distributed scenario where the data can\nbe submitted into different Archives and reused in multiple and different DBs. The development of tools\nfacilitating data sharing and able to handle this complexity is a great challenge in itself.\n\nIn this context, we introduce here the Omics Discovery Index, an open-source platform facilitating\nthe access, discovery, and dissemination of omics datasets. OmicsDI provides a unique infrastructure to integrate datasets\ncoming from multiple omics fields, including at present proteomics, genomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics.\n\nTo date, eleven resources have agreed on a common metadata structure framework and exchange format,\nand have contributed to OmicsDI, including:\n\nProteomics: The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database, PeptideAtlas, the Mass spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE)\nand the Global Proteome Machine Database (GPMDB).\nMetabolomics: MetaboLights, the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking project (GNPS),\nMetabolomeExpress, and the Metabolomics Workbench.\nThe major European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA).\nTranscriptomics:  ArrayExpress and Expression Atlas.\n\nOmicsDI stores biological and technical metadata coming from the public datasets available in every resource,\nusing an efficient indexing system, which is able to integrate differently\nbiological entities including `genes, transcripts, proteins and metabolites` with the relevant scientific literature.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Perez‐Riverol, Yasset, et al. \"Making proteomics data accessible and reusable: current state of proteomics databases and repositories.\"\nProteomics 15.5-6 (2015): 930-950.\n\n",
